When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
     You might want to use a remote repository for easier
     collaboration or easier access to your own work while
     on the go. That way it is accessible no matter where
     you are or which computer you are using, as long as
     you have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Pulling changes manually allows you full control over which files end up on
     your machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?
     Branches occur inside a repository and allow for experimentation in the
     code within one repository. Clones copy a repository to a new location.
     Forks are clones that occur exclusively on GitHub's servers. Forks allow
     GitHub to automatically attribute the author of the original repository.
     Use a fork to copy someone else's project completely inside GitHub. Use a
     clone to copy a project from GitHub or another storage area onto your
     local machine.
