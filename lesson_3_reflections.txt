When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
     You might want to use a remote repository for easier
     collaboration or easier access to your own work while
     on the go. That way it is accessible no matter where
     you are or which computer you are using, as long as
     you have internet access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     Pulling changes manually allows you full control over which files end up on
     your machine.
