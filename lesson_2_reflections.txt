What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     The .git hidden directory is created when you initialize a repository.
     A repository must be initialized before you can use the Git VC system
     withing a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
     The staging area is the step between the working directory and the
     repository. It is like a "test step" before actually creating a commit.
     Having a staging area allows you to double check which files are going to
     be added to a commit and offers the flexibility to remove files which may
     have been accidentally added before committing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
     Using the staging area along with the git diff command allows you to easily
     compare the changes made in different files before deciding to make a
     commit. You can review the changes and make sure they all relate to the
     same logical change.
